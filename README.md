## Project Overview

In the era of digital transformation, AI/ML is being increasingly applied by businesses to enhance data analysis capabilities and address business challenges quickly and efficiently. To expedite the model deployment process and maximize the reliability of AI/ML models, MLOps has emerged as a new set of standards for deploying and operating high-performance machine learning systems, including principles such as:

- Versioning and monitoring of AI/ML models' versions and performance
- Monitoring the performance of models and systems after real-world deployment
- Automating the training, deployment, maintenance, or upgrading processes of models

In this spirit, the MLOps Marathon is organized with the mission to bring MLOps principles and practical applications closer to the AI community in Vietnam, providing knowledge and a practical environment for easy grasp.

The MLOps Marathon will consist of 3 stages: Warm-up, Speed-up, and Finish-up.

- Warm-up Stage (June 5, 2023 - July 2, 2023): Participating teams familiarize themselves with the competition rules, provided data, and the system. During this period, participants will have the opportunity to deploy and operate a machine learning system on both personal machines and the server provided by the organizers.

- Speed-up Stage (July 3, 2023 - July 30, 2023): Teams are required to upgrade their machine learning system to handle uncleaned data (e.g., missing or improperly formatted values) and data with changing distributions (data drift).

- Finish-up Stage (July 31, 2023 - August 28, 2023): In this stage, the occurrences of uncleaned data and data distribution changes will be more frequent. Participating teams need to continue improving their systems to detect and address these issues.

Each stage of the marathon will be divided into 2 parts:

Part 1 (First 3-4 weeks): Teams will be provided with a set of Machine Learning problems and corresponding data. The teams' task is to train models and deploy the Serving API on personal machines.

Part 2 (Last 3 days): The organizers will provide a server for teams to deploy the Serving API. Teams should try to complete the deployment within the first 2 days. On the 3rd day, the organizers will begin evaluating the teams by sending prediction data to the API. Teams can save this data for further analysis and model improvement.
